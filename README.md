# YNAB Statistics .NET Project

![N|Solid](https://cdn.thecollegeinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/YNAB-Logo.png)

This is a .NET project to show statistics of YNAB.
For the models I have used [ynab-dotnet](https://github.com/blinard/ynab-dotnet)

### Required to use

- YNAB Subscription
 
### Own use
Ofcourse you can use these projects/models for own use!
I try to update the code regulary to make sure everything keeps working. If you see something that can be done better or when your are missing something just edit it in the code üòÅ
